        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The core of this project is the NIST questionnaire that will be delivering a maturity-based assessment model. The questionnaire will be validated though many tests on Deakin departments and a select few businesses. There will be supplementary guides to enable business to access generic information on the controls required to uplift in certain NIST categories. The Questionnaire and guides are made in a way that it can be easily transformed to work with existing infrastructure and systems.

        The goal of our project was to remove the high price of entry for a professional services aimed towards mid-scale Australian businesses.
